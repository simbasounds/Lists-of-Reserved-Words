# Vue.js List of Reserved Words
A list of words reserved by Vue.js in alphabetical order.

# Why?
It's just the way I learn sometimes.

Sometimes I'll run an app through an alphabetical sorter.
Then tweak it a bit until I have a list of all the unique words.

Then I run it through [DiffChecker](https://www.diffchecker.com) against a word list.

Sure, my code editor does highlight the syntax..
